### A transparent baseline model for default prediction – built for teaching and evaluation.

---

### Overview

This project explores the application of **logistic regression** to credit scoring, using data from Kaggle’s [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) competition. The focus is on building a simple and interpretable **Probability of Default (PD)** model, suitable for classroom instruction and for demonstrating threshold-based tradeoffs in binary classification.

The notebook is structured as a complete teaching module, with well-labeled sections, model interpretation, and visualizations. Code blocks are annotated in an appendix that links back to the main notebook content.

---

### Teaching Objectives

This project is designed for students and early-career analysts interested in:

- Modeling PD using logistic regression with imbalanced classes
- Understanding how threshold choice affects precision and recall
- Using ROC curves and confusion matrices for evaluation
- Practicing real-world model building from public credit data
